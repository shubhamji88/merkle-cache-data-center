# Merkle Cache Invalidation 

A client server prototype based on [Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems Auditing Cache Data Integrity in the Edge Computing Environment](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347436483_Transactions_on_Parallel_and_Distributed_Systems_Auditing_Cache_Data_Integrity_in_the_Edge_Computing_Environment). 

Client and Server have a tiny single threaded server running to fetch a particular file, and generate a cache map to be loaded over HTTP.

## Todo
Script to 
- fetch files which have been infected / poisoned.
- compare two trees and find the files at fault.
